## 1.2 Raspberry Pi System Introduction and Installation

### 1.2.1 Mainstream Operating System Introduction

In the previous sections, we have already mentioned that Raspberry Pi itself is a miniature computer, so how can a computer function without an operating system?

An operating system (OS) is a collection of interconnected system software programs responsible for supervising and controlling computer operations, utilizing and managing hardware and software resources, and providing common services to organize user interactions. It serves as the first layer of software on top of hardware and acts as a bridge (or interface, intermediary, etc.) for communication between hardware and other software.

One of the commonly known operating systems is Windows. It provides foundational support for the operation of other programs, such as memory management, file systems, network communication, and graphical user interfaces.

Currently, common operating systems found on personal computers or servers include Linux, Windows, macOS, and others. Similarly, there are many distributions suitable for Raspberry Pi, which are sufficient to meet the needs of different user groups. If only specific functionality is required, choosing a third-party system is also feasible. In the following sections, several distribution versions will be listed to help everyone choose the most suitable system for themselves.

(1) **NOOBS**

As the official recommended system, NOOBS (New Out of Box System) is an extremely convenient multi-system boot manager. It includes all the files of the operating system, allowing users to directly install the system without relying on the network. Simply remember to update the system after installation.

(2) **Raspbian**

Also an official recommended system, Raspbian is the preferred operating system for Raspberry Pi users and is one of the most widely used systems currently. It is a version of Debian specifically tailored for the ARM architecture of Raspberry Pi, offering rich software resources and stable system security. In China, Raspbian has multiple update sources, making it easy for both beginners and experienced users to get started.

(3) **Windows IoT Core**

Windows IoT is an operating system designed for the Internet of Things within the Microsoft ecosystem. It has been compatible with Raspberry Pi since its initial release. However, it's important to clarify that this version differs from traditional Windows iterations. Unlike previous versions, it's not confined to the x86 architecture but can also operate on the ARM architecture.

(4) **Ubuntu MATE**

Users who have experience with Linux may find this familiar. It's a variant of Ubuntu, utilizing the MATE desktop environment, and serves as an official derivative of Ubuntu Linux. This platform represents the cutting edge in smart devices, capable of running software either locally or through cloud-based services.

(5) **Kali Linux**

Kali Linux is a Debian-based distribution tailored for digital forensics and penetration testing. It comes equipped with an array of penetration testing tools right out of the box, and users have the flexibility to run Kali Linux from a hard drive, live CD, or live USB. Available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions for the X86 instruction set, as well as versions compatible with the ARM architecture.

(6) **OSMC**

The full name is Open Source Media Center, an audio-visual system officially endorsed by Raspberry Pi. It serves as a multimedia hub, facilitating playback of both local and online content, aiming to create a comprehensive home entertainment platform alongside the TV.

These are some of the more prevalent distribution systems for Raspberry Pi, marking the conclusion of the introduction to mainstream systems. Users keen on exploring further can conduct their own research. In this section, we will use the Raspbian operating system (which is based on Debian) as our illustrative example.

## 1.4 Raspberry Pi 5 Use Instructions

### 1.4.1 Display

(1) Begin by connecting the power cable of the display to the Raspberry Pi. Subsequently, connect the HDMI cable. Ensure not to reverse this order, as doing so may result in the screen not activating after connection.

(2) If you start the Raspberry Pi 5 and log into the Raspberry System remotely prior to connecting the display, the remote connection will be severed. To address this issue, simply restart the Raspberry Pi 5.

### 1.4.2 Remote Login

When the Raspberry Pi 5 is connected to a monitor, if you remotely log into the desktop system, the resolution of the screen will match that of the monitor. Even if you change the resolution in the system, it will not take effect.

To apply the modified resolution while the monitor is connected, you need to unplug the monitor and then restart the Raspberry Pi.

In the event that the modified resolution takes effect on the Raspberry Pi, if an external display is connected, the resolution of the remote desktop system will match that of the screen.

### 1.4.3 Power Supply

The Raspberry Pi requires a power supply of 5.1V/5A. If the external power source fails to deliver this voltage and current during the initial startup, the operating system will issue an alert indicating that the current consumption is limited to 600mA.

### 1.10.2 Power over Ethernet Introduction

PoE (Power over Ethernet) is a technology that enables power transmission through network cables. It utilizes existing Ethernet infrastructure to simultaneously transmit data and provide power to IP terminal devices, such as IP phones, access points (APs), IP cameras, etc. This technology is also known as Power over LAN (PoL) or Active Ethernet, depending on the LAN-based application, and is commonly referred to as Power over Ethernet.

By integrating power delivery into the network cable used for data transmission, PoE eliminates the need for separate power sources for devices like IP phones, wireless APs, portable device chargers, card machines, cameras, data collection terminals, and others. This offers advantages such as reliable connections, simplified installations, and unified standards.

To standardize and promote the development of PoE technology and address compatibility issues between power supplies and powered equipment from different manufacturers, the IEEE Standards Committee has released three PoE standards: IEEE 802.3af, IEEE 802.3at, and IEEE 802.3bt.

### 1.10.3 Applications and Advantages of Power over Ethernet (PoE) on Raspberry Pi 5

Raspberry Pi 5 inherits the Ethernet port from Raspberry Pi 4B and supports PoE power supply. This enables bidirectional transmission of data and power through a single network cable, greatly simplifying the installation and deployment of Raspberry Pi 5 in edge scenarios requiring long-term networking, such as intelligent video surveillance and industrial Internet applications. Compared to traditional designs necessitating additional power supplies, PoE technology eliminates the need for complex power line layouts, significantly reducing installation costs and mitigating later maintenance challenges.

Moreover, PoE support adheres to IEEE standards, ensuring compatibility with existing PoE infrastructure and enhancing system reliability by mitigating potential failures stemming from power supply issues. In essence, PoE lays the groundwork for the widespread commercial application of Raspberry Pi 5 in the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT).
