### 2.1.1 Preparation Before Startup

In the preceding chapters, we've readied the Raspberry Pi—similar to the process before using a new computer in daily life, where we assemble it, install the system, and then connect the wiring to prepare for startup.

Now, it's time to undertake some pre-boot tasks to kickstart the "**Raspberry Pi Journey**" officially! To begin, ensure you have a computer monitor, a set comprising a USB interface keyboard and mouse, and a Micro-HDMI cable. Depending on your monitor's interface, you may opt for an HDMI-to-VGA or HDMI-to-DVI cable to connect it.

(1) Insert the SD card containing the previously burned system image into the Raspberry Pi. Ensure that the gold finger of the SD card faces the Raspberry Pi motherboard, as depicted in the figure below:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_1/media/image2.png" />

(2) Next, connect the USB keyboard and mouse to the USB ports on the Raspberry Pi. Unlike the Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+ motherboard, two of the four USB ports on the Raspberry Pi 5 are USB 3.0 ports.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_1/media/image3.png"   />

(3) Connect one end of the HDMI cable to the HDMI port of the Raspberry Pi, and plug the other end into the corresponding port on the monitor.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_1/media/image4.png"   />

(4) Connect the power cord and switch on the power (you can press the button after plugging it into the power strip). Raspberry Pi 5 utilizes a Type-C power supply interface and supports larger power input (5.1V, 5A), thus it cannot be directly powered through the computer's USB interface.

### 2.7.2 Vim Editor Installation and Usage Tutorial

Vim supports multiple programming languages and provides a wide range of shortcut keys. It is the default editor in the Linux system. In early Unix systems, Vi served as the default editor. Vim, an improved version of Vi, offers advanced editing features including code insertion, compilation, and error navigation, thus streamlining the editing process for users.

* **Vim Mode Introduction**

Vim has three modes: command mode, insert mode, and bottom line command mode. Refer to the table below for detailed descriptions of each mode.

|     **Mode name**      |                    **Mode introduction**                     |                      **Mode function**                       |
| :--------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|      Command mode      | The default mode upon entering the Vim editor is command mode. |              Move cursor, and delete characters              |
|       Input mode       | To switch to editing mode, enter the command "i" in command mode. | In this mode, you can input characters, and pressing "ESC" will return you to command mode. |
| Last line command mode |      To enter function mode, press ":" in command mode.      | In this mode, you can execute functions such as saving files, exiting Vim, configuring Vim, searching, and more. |

To switch the mode, please refer to the following schematic.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2\section_18\media\image2.png"   />

In Input mode, you can edit the file content. "**Command mode**" serves as an intermediate state where you can view and delete code. "Last line command mode" allows you to save the entire file and exit the editor.

The relationship among these modes can be likened to the process of employees going to work. Entering the company (vi file) office (input mode) requires an employee ID (command entry). Without showing your employee ID, you can only view the building scenery as a visitor. However, by presenting your employee ID card, you can enter the company to work. At the end of the day, before leaving work, you need to punch out (last line command mode) to record (save) today's attendance record, and then exit the company (press "ENTER"), officially completing the day's work.

* **Vim Basic Operation**

We present the various key operations in the three modes in the form of a table. If you are interested in it, you can refer to additional resources for further learning.

* **Vim Operation**

(1) Start the Raspberry Pi, and open LX terminal.

(2) Although the system version we are using has the Vim editor pre-installed, it might not be the full version. Therefore, we enter the command "**sudo apt-get install -y vim**" to install the full version of the Vim editor.

```py
sudo apt-get install -y vim
```

If the following prompt appears during the installation process, you need to remove the vim-common file first. Enter the command "**sudo apt-get remove vim-common**", press Enter to delete it, and then repeat step 2.

```py
sudo apt-get remove vim-common
```

(3) To enter the Vim editor and create or edit a file, type "**vim**" followed by the name of the file you wish to edit or create. For example, to create a new plain text file named "**abc**" for demonstration, use the following format:

```py
vi abc
```

(4) Press the "**ENTER**" key to create a new file named "**abc**" and enter the Vim editor.

## 2.16 Correct Startup Method

While the Raspberry Pi functions as a microcomputer, it lacks a conventional power switch found in typical PCs. Many users simply unplug the power cord when finished, but this practice risks damaging the SD card data. The SD card serves not only as the Raspberry Pi's operating system but also stores numerous system files. To prevent potential data loss and SD card damage, it's best to shut down the system safely.

To shut down the Raspberry Pi, open the LX terminal interface and enter "sudo shutdown -h now". Note that the "-h" flag halts the system. Alternatively, omit "-h" for immediate shutdown. You can also use the "sudo halt" command, which achieves the same result more succinctly.

To schedule a shutdown at a specific time, enter "sudo shutdown -h 30" to shut down after 30 minutes. For an exact time, such as 12:30, use "sudo shutdown -h 12:30".

To reboot the device, enter "sudo reboot". Alternatively, "shutdown -r now" initiates an immediate restart. For a scheduled restart, like 13:30 and 20 seconds, enter "shutdown -r 13:30:20".

## 2.17 Raspberry Pi System Backup

### 2.17.1 Why Do We Backup System?

To mitigate potential unexpected situations such as file loss or damage, it's advisable to preemptively copy data from the Raspberry Pi SD card to other storage devices. This practice facilitates prompt recovery and system restoration, preventing the need for time-consuming and energy-intensive reconfigurations.

### 2.17.2 Backup Method

Generally, there are three ways to backup the system. The table below lists the pros and cons of these three methods.

|     Platform      |            Tool            |                          Advantage                           |                         Disadvantage                         |
| :---------------: | :------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|      Windows      | Win32Disklmager、WinImager |              Creating images is straightforward              |                        time-consuming                        |
| Raspbian（Linux） |    Command-line, script    | The resulting image files are compact, saving computer space |                the process can be cumbersome                 |
| Raspbian（Linux） |       SD Card Copier       | plug-and-play functionality offers relatively high efficiency | lacks the capability to generate image files and is challenging for batch operations |
